ofxONI1_5
=======

A simple wrapper around OpenNI 1.5 and NiTE 1.5 to use in ofxReprojection. Implements similar functionality as ofxKinect. 

Features:
* Hue-valued depth image.
* Implements ofxBase3DVideo to allow for backend switching between OpenNI and libfreenect (by using ofxKinect).
* TODO: Grayscale depth image.
* TODO: Optional NiTE integration (mainly User Tracker).
* TODO: 3D rendering (using vertex shader).
